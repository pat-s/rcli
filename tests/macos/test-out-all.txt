[0;31mERROR[0m: Passing 'arm' in the version specifier is not needed/allowed. If an arm build exists for the requested version, it is selected by default on macOS arm machines. You only need to pass the [36m--arch x86_64[0m flag if you want to explicitly install/switch to the [36mx86_64[0m version instead of the arm build. This only applies to cases in which builds for both architectures are available (which only applies to R >= 4.1.0).
R 4.1.2 is already installed - you only need to call [36mrcli switch 4.1.2[0m to use it.
