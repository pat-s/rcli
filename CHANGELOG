DEV: rcli (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * rcli now tries to be more helpful to first time users by offering to install R using the CRAN installer if no R CRAN installation is detected.
  * rcli does not suggest homebrew anymore for the initial installation of R as this would result in possibly inadvertent automatic updates for new R releases
  * rcli now tries to exist early if no installation of Rosetta2 is detected when trying to install x86 R versions
  * `rcli ls` is now an alias to `rcli list`
  * `rcli list` shows again the installed R versions
  * `rcli ls` can now also show all existing R user libraries via `rcli ls user_libs`
  * `rcli` now assumes the correct architecture when switching from arm64 to x86_64 versions
  * Two new env var config options:
    * `RCLI_ASK_USER_LIB` allows to suppress `rcli` asking if a user library should be created if none exists on macOS
    * `RCLI_QUIET` suppresses the verbose "Download R version XY" and other messages during execution
