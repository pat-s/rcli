rcli (0.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for Linux-arm-binaries via `r-hub/R` for Ubuntu and Debian
  * Source installations are now built under `/tmp`
  * Use `gdebi` instead of `dpkg` on Ubuntu/Debian for easier dependency resolution
  * Add support for RHEL

rcli (0.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * `Rscript` now works as intended. Beforehand, `Rscript` crashed as it was not able to find the corresponding `R` executable.

rcli (0.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Account for "RC" alias when scraping dev version. This should ensure that installing and switching between 'dev' versions works if the upcoming release is labelled as "RC" (#41)
  * Fixed the scraping of the current R release to make the "release" alias work again (#41)

rcli (0.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Internal rework of macOS version switching and system lib backup: no file copying anymore, instead symbolic links are used.
    This speeds up and robustifies R version switching.
  * System libs on macOS now live at `/opt/R/<R version>/Resources/library` instead of `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework`.
    This simplifies many things within `rcli` and was partly inspired by the change to use symlinks instead of file copying (where possible) to preserve static system libs across patch versions.
  * Various documentation updates

rcli (0.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * `switch()` preserves custom user packages in the system lib again (again) on macOS arm
  * env var `RCLI_ASK_USER_LIB` is now properly honored
  * `switch()` and `install()` now exit early if 'arm' is detected in the passed R version
  * internal updates to macOS arm test suite

rcli (0.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * `switch()` now works as expected (again) on macOS arm


rcli (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * `rcli install dev` was broken in 0.7.1 due to a too early translation of the devel alias into the underlying R version.
  * `remove()` now accordingly accounts for different architectures
  * `remove()` now early exits if the version which is about to be removed does not exist on disk

rcli (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * `rcli` tries to catch early if no valid R installation exists and if so, offers to installs R 4.0.5
  * Fixed an error with the `release` alias
  * `rcli ls user_libs` now also works on Linux


rcli (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `rcli remove` subcommand

rcli (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * rcli now tries to be more helpful to first time users by offering to install R using the CRAN installer if no R CRAN installation is detected.
  * rcli does not suggest homebrew anymore for the initial installation of R as this would result in possibly inadvertent automatic updates for new R releases
  * rcli now tries to exist early if no installation of Rosetta2 is detected when trying to install x86 R versions
  * `rcli ls` is now an alias to `rcli list`
  * `rcli list` shows again the installed R versions
  * `rcli ls` can now also show all existing R user libraries via `rcli ls user_libs`
  * `rcli` now assumes the correct architecture when switching from `arm64` to `x86_64` versions
  * Two new environment variable config options:
    * `RCLI_ASK_USER_LIB` allows to suppress `rcli` asking if a user library should be created if none exists on macOS
    * `RCLI_QUIET` suppresses the verbose "Download R version XY" and other messages during execution

rcli (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix reported version number (#16)
